<h1>100 Days of Code January 4th, 2020</h1>

<p>
    Day 1: January 4. Saturday
    Today's Progress: Worked on Scrimba's Course: Building a chat app with React and Chatkit
    
    Thoughts: The chatroom ID isn't working.  I get an error when I use it.  The instructor's room id is much shorter.  
    But I did create my own chatroom instance.

</p>
<p>
Day 2: January 5. Sunday  
    
Progress: Worked a bit on the Pomodoro Clock. I haven't been able to find why the timer thinks it's reached zero when it's still at 1 second remaining. I also did one lesson the the Scrimba chatroom app, and reviewed props in Andrew Mead's React course Also working on using the github workflow for this log. 
    
Thoughts: These tests are tough, but I just need to keep working on them.

<p>
Day 3: January 6. Monday
    
Progress: Worked on the Pomodoro timer.  
    
Thoughts: When the timer first starts, it runs through 2 cycles before it starts counting down.  I'm trying to figure out why that is.

</p>

<p>
Day 4: January 7. Tuesday
    
Progress: Worked on getting Pomodoro timer to reach zero.  After a lot of trial and error, I finally found a way to do it!  But the tests are still failing.  
    
Thoughts:  I still need to rework my timer to pass the tests.  I'm failing content test 8 and timer tests 1 and 8-14.

Day 5: January 8. Wednesday
    
Progress: Worked some more on Pomodoro timer.
    
Thoughts:  It looks like a lot of people are having trouble with passing the Pomodoro timer tests.  I still need to pass the last 2 calculator app tests, so I'm working on that now.

Day 19: January 22. Wednesday

I found a tutorial on how to integrate Wordpress and Gatsby.  I'm excited to give it a try.  
https://scotch.io/tutorials/blazing-fast-wordpress-sites-with-gatsby
              

</p>

<p>
Day 20: January 23. Thursday

I set up a new Gastby build and tried to integrate with Wordpress but hit an error.  I tried to use the settings from the tutorial, but it looks like I'll need to make some adjustments.
   
              

</p>

<p>
Day 21: January 24. Friday

I looked into connecting Gatsby and Wordpress.  
I'm watching this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etii9yp1J6s and I Installed Local By Flywheel 

</p>

<p>
Day 22: January 27. Monday

Dedicated a couple of days to a digital marketing campaign.  Now I'm back on track with coding.  
I spent some more time with the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etii9yp1J6s.  
I hope I can get through these errors and get this working!

</p>
<p>
Day 23: January 28. Tuesday

I continued to work on Gatsby and Wordpress integration.  I got the build started, but I'm running into errors with graphql.  
I'm looking through tutorials to find what needs to be fixed.  This one has been the best so far: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-01-22-getting-started-gatsby-and-wordpress/

</p>
<p>
Day 24: January 29. Wednesday

Went through the Gatsby docs trying to get a Wordpress site up and running.  I ran into a different error with my configuration.
I'll keep working on it.  

</p>

<p>
Day 25: January 30. Thursday

Found another good tutorial on Gatsby and Wordpress https://spinupwp.com/gatsby-headless-wordpress/.  
The article shows that there are starter templates for wordpress https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters?c=CMS%3AWordPress.  
I installed gatsby-starter-headless-wordpress, but I hit a graphql error when I tried to build it.  

</p>

<p>
Day 26: January 31. Friday

Ran a Wordpress starter template from Gatsby: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters?c=CMS%3AWordPress.  
    Hit an error when trying to switch the source over to my Flywheel Wordpress.

</p>

<p>
Day 27: February 1. Saturday

Working on getting a Gatsby Wordpress build up and running.  I think the problem is with the file path of my Flywheel site.  
The Gatsby wordpress url works, but I get GraphQL errors when using my local site link.  
    I went back through the tutorial https://watch-learn.com/gatsbyjs-wordpress/getting-posts-and-pages and followed his setup process, but I haven't found the issue.  

</p>

<p>
Day 28: February 2. Sunday
Started a new gatsby build and began building a simple client website.  
The starter file is well laid out, and React makes it easy.
https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/starters/

</p>

<p>
Day 29: February 3. Monday
I'm working on adding a navbar, which led me to this info on creating dynamic navigation https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/creating-dynamic-navigation/.

</p>
<p>
Day 30: February 4. Tuesday
Successfully added the navigation and added some CSS.  Project is moving along, and working with Gatsby is a lot of fun.  Hooking the site up to Wordpress will be the challenging part.  
</p>
<p>
Day 31: February 5. Wednesday
I added additional pages to the website.  Next I need to figure out how to make the homepage a different color from the other pages.  Also need to make Navbar mobile friendly. 
</p>
<p>
Day 32: February 6. Thursday
I'm working on moving the site into Wordpress now.  Still running into errors that need to be worked through.   
</p>

<p>
Day 33: February 7. Friday
I worked on the Gatsby build errors, but haven't been able to get it running yet.  It might be an issue with Local By Flywheel, but I'm not sure.  I'll keep trying. 
</p>
<p>
Day 34: February 8. Saturday
I didn't have any success with Gatsby Wordpress today.  After trying a number of times to get my config file set up correctly,
I tried a starter wordpress site, but that isn't working either.    
</p>

<p>
Day 35: February 9. Sunday
Found this tutorial today: https://dev.to/nevernull/basic-wordpress-gatsby-setup-guide-to-gatsby-wordpress-starter-advanced-with-previews-i18n-and-more-44d8.
I'm about halfway through it.  I like the graphql plugins for wordpress.    
</p>

<p>
Day 36: February 10. Monday
I read through the docs used in the tutorial https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme and https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-graphql/ then moved over to 
a YouTube video that does a good job of explaining things https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIMFx0niV08&list=PL0TiIcOKyEAkDLsLsFc8BYzHXi3DEhKCe&index=11.  There are a lot of great resources to make this work.
   
</p>
<p>
Day 37: February 11. Tuesday
I found the next tutorial to be a great help in understanding how to query from graphql: https://youtu.be/pLbGECQvd7I.  I needed to go back to work on my file setup.
</p>

<p>
Day 38: February 12. Wednesday
I went through the tutorial but I hit an error in graphql.  I'm going to try the tutorial again with the same gatsby starter file he uses.  https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/
</p>

<p>
Day 39: February 13. Thursday
I tried using the gatsby starter, but I'm still getting errors.  I'm hopeful that I can get it working though.
</p>

<p>
Day 40: February 14. Friday
Connecting Gatsby to Wordpress still isn't working.  A friend did send me a link to a new tutorial that takes a different approach: https://staticfuse.com/blog/how-to-build-headless-wordpress-sites-with-gatsby/#gettingstarted.
    Hope this way works.  
</p>

<p>
Day 41: February 15. Saturday
I worked through the tutorial I started yesterday, but ran into a few problems.  I'm getting graphql errors when I try to build.  I did find that Contentful makes it easier, so I may try that.  
</p>

<p>
Day 42: February 16. Sunday
I've put integration with Wordpress on the backburner while I build a site in Gatsby.  It's much more fun.    
</p>

<p>
Day 43: February 17. Monday
I realized the site needed a mobile friendly menu.  react-burger-menu is awesome.  Super easy to use, and lots of cool options.  
</p>

<p>
Day 44: February 18. Tuesday
I thought I was all set with react-burger-menu, but I found any click on the screen opens the menu.  I've been looking for a way to limit the menu to just a selected area.  
I'm not sure why it's behaving this way.  It's a good learning experience, but I want to solve it soon.  
</p>

<p>
Day 45: February 19. Wednesday
I was stuck the whole time on this react-burger-menu.  I looked at other options and tried a bunch of things.  Finally adding the CSS fixed the issue!  This tutorial was helpful: https://alligator.io/react/react-burger-menu-sidebar/  
</p>

<p>
Day 46: February 20. Thursday
I replaced the logo text with an image in the body and header of the site.  I still need to adjust the mobile menu CSS.  
I've been uploading the project to github which I've been meaning to incorporate into my daily workflow for a while.  
This cheatsheet is awesome: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
</p>

<p>
Day 47: February 21. Friday
I checked that the images were breaking my netlify build.  Looking for solutions.
</p>

<p>
Day 48: February 22. Saturday
Found the source of the problem.  I think I'm going to install image plugins and see if I can get the images to load that way. 
</p>

<p>
Day 49: February 23. Sunday
I'm still strugging to get my images set up correctly.  This page is helpful: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-gatsby-image/.    
</p>

<p>
Day 50: February 24. Monday 
Images are finally displaying! The site is live at https://nostalgic-hermann-56183d.netlify.com
</p>

<p>
Day 51: February 25. Tuesday 
I fixed some of the CSS.  I see a big issue with empty whitespace on the ipad.  I'm looking into what needs to be adjusted.  
Once I get this finalized, I plan to update my portfolio, and fix my calculator app.
</p>

<p>
Day 52: February 26. Wednesday 
I messed around with the css for a while and couldn't find any issues.  Looks like the site is ready.  Time to move on to my calculator css.  
</p>

<p>
Day 53: February 27. Thursday
Fixed my calculator app css: https://codepen.io/gavinsimon1/full/GVozOb. Thank you to this awesome tutorial: https://freshman.tech/css-grid-calculator/  
Also added an about page to the Gatsby site: https://nostalgic-hermann-56183d.netlify.com/about
</p>

<p>
Day 54: February 28. Friday
I started working on a surf report app today.  I found a really helpful article by Taylor Ho https://medium.com/@tkmh/how-i-built-surf-status-2ca2ca8a6fbf
I also needed to refresh my memory on fetching data from an API.  Scrimba's react tutorial is so awesome: https://scrimba.com/p/p7P5Hd/c79Jask.
My project is currently console logging starwars data from an API.  Not a surf app yet, but a good start. https://codepen.io/gavinsimon1/pen/QWbvJLb?editors=1111
</p>

<p>
Day 55: February 29. Saturday
I found there was a big issue with the Gatsby website body.  Updated that and worked on the text responsiveness.  Lots of fun with CSS.  

</p>

<p>
Day 56: March 1. Sunday
I tried to use the surfline API today with the starwars api setup in codepen.  I wasn't able to get any data though, so I looked for ideas.  
This project is really cool: https://github.com/swrobel/meta-surf-forecast#new-api-v2.  I also updated the header of my Gatsby site, and pushed it
to github from memory.  

</p>

<p>
Day 57: March 2. Monday
Found a great api walkthrough https://blog.hellojs.org/fetching-api-data-with-react-js-460fe8bbf8f2.  
I was able to start working with the info from this fun api https://randomuser.me/
</p>

<p>
Day 58: March 3. Tuesday
I messed around with Postman, to learn about the API structure.  I also looked into using React hooks with an API.  I was able to console.log the data yesterday, but when I tried to map it, I got a blank screen.  More work to do.  
</p>

<p>
Day 59: March 4. Wednesday
Looked at APIs and added a background image to the weather api project https://codepen.io/gavinsimon1/full/opRbVY  
</p>
