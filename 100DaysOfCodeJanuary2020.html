<h1>100 Days of Code January 4th, 2020</h1>

<p>
    Day 1: January 4. Saturday
    Today's Progress: Worked on Scrimba's Course: Building a chat app with React and Chatkit
    
    Thoughts: The chatroom ID isn't working.  I get an error when I use it.  The instructor's room id is much shorter.  
    But I did create my own chatroom instance.

Day 2: January 5. Sunday  
    
Progress: Worked a bit on the Pomodoro Clock. I haven't been able to find why the timer thinks it's reached zero when it's still at 1 second remaining. I also did one lesson the the Scrimba chatroom app, and reviewed props in Andrew Mead's React course Also working on using the github workflow for this log. 
    
Thoughts: These tests are tough, but I just need to keep working on them.

<p>
Day 3: January 6. Monday
    
Progress: Worked on the Pomodoro timer.  
    
Thoughts: When the timer first starts, it runs through 2 cycles before it starts counting down.  I'm trying to figure out why that is.

Day 4: January 7. Tuesday
    
Progress: Worked on getting Pomodoro timer to reach zero.  After a lot of trial and error, I finally found a way to do it!  But the tests are still failing.  
    
Thoughts:  I still need to rework my timer to pass the tests.  I'm failing content test 8 and timer tests 1 and 8-14.

Day 5: January 8. Wednesday
    
Progress: Worked some more on Pomodoro timer.
    
Thoughts:  It looks like a lot of people are having trouble with passing the Pomodoro timer tests.  I still need to pass the last 2 calculator app tests, so I'm working on that now.

</p>

<p>
Day 20: January 23. Thursday

I set up a new Gastby build and tried to integrate with Wordpress but hit an error.  I tried to use the settings from the tutorial, but it looks like I'll need to make some adjustments.
   
              

</p>

<p>
Day 21: January 24. Friday

I looked into connecting Gatsby and Wordpress.

</p>

<p>
Day 22: January 27. Monday

Dedicated a couple of days to a digital marketing campaign.  Now I'm back on track with coding.  
I spent some more time with the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etii9yp1J6s.  
I hope I can get through these errors and get this working!

</p>
<p>
Day 23: January 28. Tuesday

I continued to work on Gatsby and Wordpress integration.  I got the build started, but I'm running into errors with graphql.  
I'm looking through tutorials to find what needs to be fixed.  This one has been the best so far: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-01-22-getting-started-gatsby-and-wordpress/

</p>
<p>
Day 24: January 29. Wednesday

Went through the Gatsby docs trying to get a Wordpress site up and running.  I ran into a different error with my configuration.
I'll keep working on it.  

</p>

<p>
Day 25: January 30. Thursday

Found another good tutorial on Gatsby and Wordpress https://spinupwp.com/gatsby-headless-wordpress/.  
The article shows that there are starter templates for wordpress https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters?c=CMS%3AWordPress.  
I installed gatsby-starter-headless-wordpress, but I hit a graphql error when I tried to build it.  

</p>

<p>
Day 26: January 31. Friday

Ran a Wordpress starter template from Gatsby: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters?c=CMS%3AWordPress.  
    Hit an error when trying to switch the source over to my Flywheel Wordpress.

</p>

<p>
Day 27: February 1. Saturday

Working on getting a Gatsby Wordpress build up and running.  I think the problem is with the file path of my Flywheel site.  
The Gatsby wordpress url works, but I get GraphQL errors when using my local site link.  
    I went back through the tutorial https://watch-learn.com/gatsbyjs-wordpress/getting-posts-and-pages and followed his setup process, but I haven't found the issue.  

</p>

<p>
Day 28: February 2. Sunday
Started a new gatsby build and began building a simple client website.  
The starter file is well laid out, and React makes it easy.

</p>

<p>
Day 29: February 3. Monday
I'm working on adding a navbar, which led me to this info on creating dynamic navigation https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/creating-dynamic-navigation/.

</p>
<p>
Day 30: February 4. Tuesday
Successfully added the navigation and added some CSS.  Project is moving along, and working with Gatsby is a lot of fun.  Hooking the site up to Wordpress will be the challenging part.  
</p>
<p>
Day 31: February 5. Wednesday
I added additional pages to the website.  Next I need to figure out how to make the homepage a different color from the other pages.  Also need to make Navbar mobile friendly. 
</p>
<p>
Day 32: February 6. Thursday
I'm working on moving the site into Wordpress now.  Still running into errors that need to be worked through.
