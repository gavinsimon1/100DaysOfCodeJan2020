<h1>100 Days of Code January 4th, 2020</h1>

<p>
    Day 1: January 4. Saturday
    Today's Progress: Worked on Scrimba's Course: Building a chat app with React and Chatkit
    
    Thoughts: The chatroom ID isn't working.  I get an error when I use it.  The instructor's room id is much shorter.  
    But I did create my own chatroom instance.

Day 2: January 5. Sunday  
    
Progress: Worked a bit on the Pomodoro Clock. I haven't been able to find why the timer thinks it's reached zero when it's still at 1 second remaining. I also did one lesson the the Scrimba chatroom app, and reviewed props in Andrew Mead's React course Also working on using the github workflow for this log. 
    
Thoughts: These tests are tough, but I just need to keep working on them.

Day 3: January 6. Monday
    
Progress: Worked on the Pomodoro timer.  
    
Thoughts: When the timer first starts, it runs through 2 cycles before it starts counting down.  I'm trying to figure out why that is.

Day 4: January 7. Tuesday
    
Progress: Worked on getting Pomodoro timer to reach zero.  After a lot of trial and error, I finally found a way to do it!  But the tests are still failing.  
    
Thoughts:  I still need to rework my timer to pass the tests.  I'm failing content test 8 and timer tests 1 and 8-14.

Day 5: January 8. Wednesday
    
Progress: Worked some more on Pomodoro timer.
    
Thoughts:  It looks like a lot of people are having trouble with passing the Pomodoro timer tests.  I still need to pass the last 2 calculator app tests, so I'm working on that now.
